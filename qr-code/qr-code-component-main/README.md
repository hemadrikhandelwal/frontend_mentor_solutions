## Overview
The QR Code Component is a simple yet well-structured UI card built using
semantic HTML, modern CSS practices, and Tailwind CSS utilities.  
The component is fully centered, responsive, and designed with a
content-driven layout approach (avoiding fixed heights).

This project demonstrates my understanding of:
- Flexbox-based layouts
- Component-oriented CSS naming
- Responsive sizing using `max-width`
- Clean separation between layout and styling responsibilities

## My process
 
 I approached this project with a component-first mindset. The focus was on
building a reusable card layout using Flexbox, ensuring proper alignment,
spacing, and readability across screen sizes.

Special attention was given to:
- Avoiding fixed heights
- Using meaningful, responsibility-based class names
- Keeping the HTML structure simple and semantic

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Tailwind CSS
- Google Fonts (Outfit)

### What I learned

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

- Creating card components using `max-width` instead of fixed dimensions
- Managing layout and spacing with Flexbox
- Writing cleaner, more maintainable CSS class names
- Structuring small UI components in a scalable way
- Combining utility-first CSS (Tailwind) with custom component styles


### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to focus on:
- Improving CSS architecture and folder structure
- Strengthening naming conventions across components
- Practicing more layout patterns using both Flexbox and Grid
- Building reusable UI components with better accessibility
