## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- TailWind CSS
- Custom font integration using @font-face

### What I learned

While working on this project, I focused on improving structure, styling consistency, and maintainability.

Key learnings include:

- Using semantic HTML (main, section, headings) to improve accessibility and readability

- Managing a consistent color system using CSS custom properties

- Understanding the limitations of Tailwind CDN, especially around @apply

- Structuring layouts cleanly with Flexbox

- Improving UI feedback using hover and focus states

### Continued development

Going forward, I plan to focus on:

- Improving accessibility (keyboard navigation, ARIA roles, contrast)

- Creating reusable UI components to avoid repetition

- Moving from Tailwind CDN to a build-based setup for better scalability

- Enhancing responsive behavior using Tailwind breakpoints

- Applying a design-system mindset for future projects
